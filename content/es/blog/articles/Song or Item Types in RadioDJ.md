# Song or Item Types in RadioDJ

RadioDJ Track Types

**STATION IDs**  
Station ID's are short duration audio recordings (i.e. less than 15 seconds) which identify the station name, frequency, and slogan, and they always reflect the marketing branding and image that the station wants to promote, i.e. "WNEW - The Newest Hits!" (spoken in an upbeat, happy, excited voice, etc). They usually utilize an audio background melody ("jingle") as a branding method to store this melody into the listener's memory ("a catchy melody"). This helps the listener recall which station they listen to the most often, when asked by marketing research polls and surveys, which is important for setting advertising rates based on the percentage of the listening market.  
Note, they are played as stand-alone elements, not overlayed on top of audio during the intro or outro of a song.  
RadioDJ Track Type = 2.Jingle  
  
**SWEEPERs**  
Sweepers are very short duration audio recordings (i.e. less than 5 seconds) announcing the name of the station with background audio elements and sound effects that reinforce the marketing branding of the station (upbeat pop, or aggressive rock n roll), which are inserted in-between programmed songs, and remind the listener of the name of the station they are listening, to strengthen their memory of their favorite station name. They are very similar to Station ID's, but shorter in duration. They are named "sweepers" because they "move" the program forward to the next piece of content, i.e. music song, talk segment.  
Note, they can be are played as stand-alone elements, or they can be overlayed on top of audio during the intro or outro of a song, if they are overlayed, they do not use any background music bed in the recording.  
RadioDJ Track Type = Sweepers.  
  
**LINERS**  
Liners are longer duration audio recordings (i.e. less than 30 seconds), and are similar to Station ID's, but they have a less formal attitude to them, i.e. they can be funny, unique, not as serious as formal Station ID's. Examples:  

  
- Music Artists - "Hi this is Michael Jackson, when I'm in town, I listen to WNEW!"
- Funny sayings - "Have you been put to sleep by another radio station's boring music? Listen to the fun people on WNEW!

They are named "Liners", because they are usually a 1 line sentence.  
Note, they are often played as overlays on top of audio during the intro or outro of a song.  
RadioDJ Track Type = Sweepers  
  
**VOICEOVERS**  
Voiceovers are a pre-recorded voice track of short duration (i.e. less than 30 seconds) that sounds like a live dj is talking, but it's actually a recording playing as an overlay on top of the song music during the intro or outro.  
RadioDJ Track Type = Voiceover  
  
**PROMOTIONS**  
Promos are audio recordings of short duration (i.e. 30 seconds) that announce promotions for a content themed radio show, i.e. "Weekly Top 40 Countdown" and include the day and time that the show will be live on the radio.  
Note, they are played as stand-alone elements, not overlayed on top of audio during the intro or outro of a song.  
RadioDJ Track Type = Commercials (even though they are not paid commercials, they are advertising a show)  
  
**BUMPERS**  
Bumpers are audio recordings of short duration (i.e. less than 10 seconds) that are used to transition between different program content, such as changing from previously played set of "fast tempo" songs, into an upcoming set of "slow tempo" songs, or when switching from one on-air personality's show, to another on-air personality's show, "and now it's time for 2 hours of the dopest rap music with NoFool2Kool on WNEW!"  
RadioDJ Track Type = Sweepers
